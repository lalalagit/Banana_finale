						<h3>The Problem</h3>
						<p class="about-desc no-margin">Nowdays a lot of old people stay alone at home and don't have the ability to earn money or meet new people. They'd love to change that. On the other hand there are students, who don't have much money and they're always hungry.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<h3>Target audience</h3>
						<p class="about-desc">Grandmas and elderly people, who need extra money and attention</p>
						<p class="about-desc no-margin">Students, who'd love to eat pancakes and have mobile phones</p>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<h3>Idea</h3>
						<p class="about-desc">What if we let grandmas make pancakes and feed them to young guys nearby? The heve a lot of time to make pancakes and can earn.</p>
						<img class="about-image" src="desc1.jpg">
						<p class="about-desc">Students download the app and see pancakes located nearby, so they can call the granny and get some food</p>

					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<h3>How we earn</h3>
						<p class="about-desc">For students the app will cost 2$ to see the place nearby, where pancakes can be ready in 2 hours. They pick a place and app sends request to the chosen Grandma</p>
						<p class="about-desc no-margin">Grandmas get 1$ for each student pancaked</p>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<h3>Security</h3>
						<p class="about-desc">We love Grandmas, so students have to first verify their identity</p>
